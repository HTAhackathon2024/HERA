This package was developed with funding from the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under award no. R01AI138783. The content of this package is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health. The theoretical underpinnings of 'dampack''s functionality are detailed in Hunink et al. (2014) &lt;doi:10.1017/CBO9781139506779&gt;.","A pilot package to try, test, improve and continuously develop functions to create and analyze decision-analytic models (DAM).","VNATDET project","A minimal cost-effectiveness decision tree analysis package. Designed specifically for building and running decision trees with several helper functions and simple interfaces.","What the package does (one paragraph).","S3 package for QALY calculation and plotting.","An R package for creating and running reproducible and transparent health economic models. Models of various types are creating using a consistent tabular structure which defines features of the model such as the strategies being compared and the health states between which patients transit.","Diagnostic and prognostic models are typically evaluated with measures of accuracy that do not address clinical consequences. Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes, but often require collection of additional information may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. Decision curve analysis is a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results. See the following references for details on the methods: Vickers (2006) &lt;doi:10.1177/0272989X06295361&gt;, Vickers (2008) &lt;doi:10.1186/1472-6947-8-53&gt;, and Pfeiffer (2020) &lt;doi:10.1002/bimj.201800240&gt;.","A package designed to perform discrete event simulation for cost-effectiveness modelling.","The goal of the package 'aldvmm' is to fit adjusted limited     dependent variable mixture models of health state utilities. Adjusted     limited dependent variable mixture models are finite mixtures of normal     distributions with an accumulation of density mass at the limits, and a gap     between 100% quality of life and the next smaller utility value. The     package 'aldvmm' uses the likelihood and expected value functions proposed     by Hernandez Alava and Wailoo (2015) &lt;doi:10.1177/1536867X1501500307&gt; using     normal component distributions and a multinomial logit model of     probabilities of component membership.","This package uses the `data.tree` package for simply specifying decision tree models in health economics, and includes utilities for visualisation and applying model to arbitrary PSA data.","Modules from the readyforwhatsnext youth mental health economic model (https://readyforwhatsnext.org/) that can be used to develop, assess, report and share utility mapping models. Outputs produced through use of TTU package modules are designed to integrate with health economic models developed with the ready4 framework (https://www.ready4-dev.com/). This development version of the TTU package has been made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the package. If you have any questions, please contact the authors (matthew.hamilton1@monash.edu).","Calculates Disability-Adjusted Life Years for individuals or populations to quantify disease burden. Outputs a vector of Years of Life Lost, Years Lived in Disease, and total DALYs","CEACT (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Toolkit for Clinical Trials) is a comprehensive R package designed to facilitate the economic evaluation of healthcare interventions within the context of clinical trials. It offers a suite of analytical tools and models to assess the cost-effectiveness of medical treatments, integrating both clinical outcomes and economic considerations. The package supports various types of cost-effectiveness analyses, including incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost-utility analyses (CUAs).","Takes a set of transition probabilities and calculates the Markov trace (i.e. proportions of cohort in each state at eact time period), then applies values to each (eg costs, health state utilities) for use in health economic evaluations / cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses. The package is built as a 'no-frills' approach, with a focus on computational speed, thus is quite efficient for probabilistic analyses.","Contains a suite of functions for survival analysis in health economics.    These can be used to run survival models under a frequentist (based on maximum likelihood)    or a Bayesian approach (both based on Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation or Hamiltonian    Monte Carlo). To run the Bayesian models, the user needs to install additional modules     (packages), i.e. 'survHEinla' and 'survHEhmc'. These can be installed using     'remotes::install_github' from their GitHub repositories:     (&lt;https://github.com/giabaio/survHEhmc&gt; and &lt;https://github.com/giabaio/survHEinla/&gt;     respectively). 'survHEinla' is based on the package INLA, which is available for download at    &lt;https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable/&gt;. The user can specify a set of parametric models     using a common notation and select the preferred mode of inference. The results can also be     post-processed to produce probabilistic sensitivity analysis and can be used to export the     output to an Excel file (e.g. for a Markov model, as often done by modellers and     practitioners). &lt;doi:10.18637/jss.v095.i14&gt;.","A module to complement the backbone structure of the package 'survHE' and expand its functionality to run survival models under a Bayesian approach (based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo). &lt;doi:10.18637/jss.v095.i14&gt;.","A collection of extenstions to the rpsftm package to enable descriptive analysis of trials affected by treatment switching and enable additional analysis of rpsft models.","This package digitizes published Kaplan-Meier survival curves in the form of jpegs or pngs for the purpose of generating a representative dataset.","A generalised workflow for generation of subject weights to be     used in Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison (MAIC) per Signorovitch et     al. (2012) &lt;doi:10.1016/j.jval.2012.05.004&gt;, Signorovitch et al (2010)     &lt;doi:10.2165/11538370-000000000-00000&gt;. In MAIC, unbiased     comparison between outcomes of two trials is facilitated by weighting the    subject-level outcomes of one trial with weights derived such that the     weighted aggregate measures of the prognostic or effect modifying variables     are equal to those of the sample in the comparator trial. The functions and    classes included in this package wrap and abstract the process demonstrated    in the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision     Support Unit (NICE DSU)'s example (Phillippo et al, (2016) [see URL]),    providing a repeatable and easily specifiable workflow for producing     multiple comparison variable sets against a variety of target studies, with    preprocessing for a number of aggregate target forms (e.g. mean, median,     domain limits).","A group of functions designed to perform survival analyses.","Network meta-analyses (mixed treatment comparisons) in the Bayesian    framework using JAGS. Includes methods to assess heterogeneity and    inconsistency, and a number of standard visualizations.    van Valkenhoef et al. (2012) &lt;doi:10.1002/jrsm.1054&gt;;    van Valkenhoef et al.
