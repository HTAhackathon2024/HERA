This HTA hub is designed to provide an inventory of R packages related to health economics. It is aimed at health economists and R developers.

The hub lists all relevant packages published on Github, and provides information on code quality.

This project was started as part of a R-HTA Hackathon held at the University of Belfast on 5th and 6th August 2024.
