HERA is designed to provide an inventory of R packages related to health economics. It is aimed at health economists and R developers.
The following table is autogenerated by retrieving package metadata from Github and CRAN.

For a human-curated list of health economics R packages, please visit the [Get Started Page](/getstarted.html), last updated August 2024.

This project was started as part of a R-HTA Hackathon held at the University of Belfast on 5th and 6th August 2024.

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("data/data.csv", check.names = FALSE)

                scrollY = TRUE)
              )
