HERA is designed to provide an inventory of R packages related to health economics. It is aimed at health economists and R developers.
The following table is autogenerated by retrieving package metadata from Github and CRAN.

For a human-curated list of health economics R packages, please visit the [getstarted.qmd](Get Started page), last updated August 2024.

This project was started as part of a R-HTA Hackathon held at the University of Belfast on 5th and 6th August 2024.
