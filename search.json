It is aimed at health economists and R developers.\nThe hub provides an automated listing of relevant packages published on Github, and provides information on code quality.\nThe hub features a data scraping tool that searches through Github using keywords related to health economic modeling, and renders it on the hub.qmd.\nFor a curated list of health economics R packages, please visit the getstarted.qmd, last updated August 2024.\nThis project was started as part of a R-HTA Hackathon held at the University of Belfast on 5th and 6th August 2024."
