Below you can find a starter on the most common packages divided by indication. # State transition models State transition models are used to describe transitions between health states (e.g.Â healthy to sick). A number of models are available to implement in R. ## Decision trees - {rdecision} - {data.tree} ## Markov models - {mstate} - {hesim} - {heemod} ## Microsimulation - {gems} - Generalized Multistate Simulation Model"

    "text": "The HTA hub is designed to provide an inventory of R packages related to health economics. It is aimed at health economists and R developers.\nThe hub provides an automated listing of relevant packages published on Github, and provides information on code quality.\nThe hub features a data scraping tool that searches through Github using keywords related to health economic modeling, and renders it on the hub.qmd.\nFor a curated list of health economics R packages, please visit the getstarted.qmd, last updated August 2024.\nThis project was started as part of a R-HTA Hackathon held at the University of Belfast on 5th and 6th August 2024."
