"survHE","Survival Analysis in Health Economic Evaluation","Contains a suite of functions for survival analysis in health economics.    These can be used to run survival models under a frequentist (based on maximum likelihood)    or a Bayesian approach (both based on Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation or Hamiltonian    Monte Carlo). To run the Bayesian models, the user needs to install additional modules     (packages), i.e. 'survHEinla' and 'survHEhmc'. These can be installed using     'remotes::install_github' from their GitHub repositories:     (<https://github.com/giabaio/survHEhmc> and <https://github.com/giabaio/survHEinla/>     respectively). 'survHEinla' is based on the package INLA, which is available for download at    <https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable/>. The user can specify a set of parametric models     using a common notation and select the preferred mode of inference. The results can also be     post-processed to produce probabilistic sensitivity analysis and can be used to export the     output to an Excel file (e.g. for a Markov model, as often done by modellers and     practitioners). <doi:10.18637/jss.v095.i14>.","GPL (>= 3)","Gianluca Baio, Andrea Berardi, Philip Cooney, Andrew Jones, Nathan Green","Gianluca Baio","2024-10-04 09:50:02 UTC",TRUE,FALSE,6,41,TRUE
