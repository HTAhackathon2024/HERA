"dcurve","Decision Curve Analysis for Model Evaluation","Diagnostic and prognostic models are typically evaluated with measures of accuracy that do not address clinical consequences. Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes, but often require collection of additional information may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. Decision curve analysis is a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences, requires only the data set on which the models are tested, and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results. See the following references for details on the methods: Vickers (2006) <doi:10.1177/0272989X06295361>, Vickers (2008) <doi:10.1186/1472-6947-8-53>, and Pfeiffer (2020) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201800240>.","MIT + file LICENSE","Daniel D.

"aldvmm","Adjusted Limited Dependent Variable Mixture Models","The goal of the package 'aldvmm' is to fit adjusted limited 
    dependent variable mixture models of health state utilities. Adjusted 
    limited dependent variable mixture models are finite mixtures of normal 
    distributions with an accumulation of density mass at the limits, and a gap 
    between 100% quality of life and the next smaller utility value. The 
    package 'aldvmm' uses the likelihood and expected value functions proposed 
    by Hernandez Alava and Wailoo (2015) <doi:10.1177/1536867X1501500307> using 
    normal component distributions and a multinomial logit model of

The package is built as a 'no-frills' approach, with a focus on computational speed, thus is quite efficient for probabilistic analyses.","GPL-2","Ed Wilson","Ed Wilson <ed.wilson@uea.ac.uk>",NA,FALSE,TRUE,1,FALSE
"survHE","Survival Analysis in Health Economic Evaluation","Contains a suite of functions for survival analysis in health economics.
    These can be used to run survival models under a frequentist (based on maximum likelihood)
    or a Bayesian approach (both based on Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation or Hamiltonian
    Monte Carlo). To run the Bayesian models, the user needs to install additional modules 
    (packages), i.e. 'survHEinla' and 'survHEhmc'. These can be installed using 
    'remotes::install_github' from their GitHub repositories: 
    (<https://github.com/giabaio/survHEhmc> and <https://github.com/giabaio/survHEinla/> 
    respectively). 'survHEinla' is based on the package INLA, which is available for download at
    <https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable/>. The user can specify a set of parametric models 
    using a common notation and select the preferred mode of inference. The results can also be 
    post-processed to produce probabilistic sensitivity analysis and can be used to export the 
    output to an Excel file (e.g. for a Markov model, as often done by modellers and 
    practitioners). <doi:10.18637/jss.v095.i14>.","GPL (>= 3)","Gianluca Baio, Andrea Berardi, Philip Cooney, Andrew Jones, Nathan Green","Gianluca Baio",NA,TRUE,FALSE,6,TRUE

    <doi:10.2165/11538370-000000000-00000>. In MAIC, unbiased

    subject-level outcomes of one trial with weights derived such that the 
    weighted aggregate measures of the prognostic or effect modifying variables 
    are equal to those of the sample in the comparator trial. The functions and
    classes included in this package wrap and abstract the process demonstrated
    in the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision 
    Support Unit (NICE DSU)'s example (Phillippo et al, (2016) [see URL]),
    providing a repeatable and easily specifiable workflow for producing 
    multiple comparison variable sets against a variety of target studies, with
